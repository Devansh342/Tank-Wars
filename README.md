# Tank-Wars

Developed a GUI based user game using socket programming concept with Python programming language as part of Computer Networks Lab project.

Using the concepts of client server programming we tried to make a game similar to pocket tanks. We used socket programming and developed a turn-based game. The turn based synchronization was achieved using Peterson's algorithm. So, here we tried to combine the concepts of process synchronization and client server communication using sockets.
